# Animal Pet Status
This project is a mod for a game [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) which shows you the names of the animals you haven't pet this day.

## How to use it
You can toggle the mod on/off by pressing the **P** key. 
When the mod is on, it shows you the names of the animals you haven't pet yet in the corner of your screen. After you pet an animal it will disappear from the list.
